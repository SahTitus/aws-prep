# Three-Tier Architecture Best Practices

- **Deploy across multiple Availability Zones (AZs)** within a Region  
- Use **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** for **automatic recovery**  
- Implement **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to **distribute traffic**  

**Explanation:**  
These features work together to ensure **high availability** and **fault tolerance** in a three-tier architecture.
