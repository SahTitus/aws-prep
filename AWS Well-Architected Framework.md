# AWS Well-Architected

## Performance efficiency - `adopting to evolving technologies.`

The performance efficiency pillar includes the ability to **use cloud resources efficiently** to **meet performance requirements,** and to **maintain that efficiency** as **demand changes** and **`technologies evolve.`**

### Design Principles

* Democratize advanced technologies
* Go global in minutes
* Use serverless architectures
* Experiment more often
* Consider mechanical sympathy




## **Operational excellence** - `run workloads effectively and continuously improve processes`

- `Traceability - monitoring for compliance, and continuous improvement`

- The **Operational Excellence pillar** focuses on **monitoring, auditing, and improving operational procedures**.

- Using **AWS Config** to track and evaluate changes ensures **traceability, compliance, and continuous improvement** in operations.

Operational excellence (OE) is a commitment to **build software correctly** while **consistently delivering a great customer experience.** The operational excellence pillar **contains best practices for organizing** your team, designing your workload, operating it at scale, and evolving it over time

**Organization, Prepare, Operate & Evolve**

### **Design principles**:

1. Organize teams around business outcomes
2. Implement observability for actionable insights
3. Safely automate where possible
4. Make frequent, small, reversible changes
5. Refine operations procedures frequently
6. Anticipate failure
7. Learn from all operational events and metrics
8. Use managed services
9. **Create `annotated documentation`**: The **Operational Excellence pillar** emphasizes **improving and automating operations**, including **`documenting procedures and operational knowledge`** to enable `repeatable and reliable processes`.

## Reliablity or `dependability` - `Automate change management & stop guessing capacity`

The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a **workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to.** This includes the **ability to operate and test the workload** through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing **reliable workloads** on AWS.

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change through automation

## Cost optimization

The Cost Optimization pillar includes the **ability to run systems to deliver business value** at the **lowest price point.**

### Design Principles

- Implement Cloud Financial Management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure
