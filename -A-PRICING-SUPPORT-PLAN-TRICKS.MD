### **AWS Support Plans – One-Rhyme Memory Version**

**Basic**
*“Free for all, docs and re:Post call,
Core checks only, no TAM at all.”*

**Developer**
*“Experiment and test, keep less stressed,
<24h general, <12h when system’s distressed,
Core checks stay, no TAM sway, business-hour help lights the way.”*

**Business**
*“Production hums, 4h impaired, 1h if down,
Full checks unlocked, 24/7 support all around,
Slack app, API, automation too — proactive guidance comes for you.”*

**Enterprise On-Ramp**
*“Critical workloads in sight, 30min for business down at night,
Full checks, TAM pool, proactive rule, Countdown once for guidance jewel.”*

**Enterprise**
*“Mission-critical call, 15min response for all,
Full checks + priority recs, TAM designated, deep dives and workshops flex,
Countdown and Concierge billing make support apex.”*

---

✅ **Trick to memorize:**

* **Basic → Developer → Business → Enterprise On-Ramp → Enterprise** → think **“Free, Test, Prod, Critical, Top”**
* Response times shrink as you climb the ladder.
* TAM appears only from **Enterprise On-Ramp** onward.
* Trusted Advisor: **Core → Core → Full → Full → Full + Priority**
* Channels: **Docs → Email → 24/7 → 24/7 + Proactive → 24/7 + TAM Concierge**
