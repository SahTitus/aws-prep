# Amazon EC2 Elasticity and Virtualization Management

**Virtualization management** is the feature that enables **Amazon EC2 instances** to be **elastic** in response to changing workload demands.


**Virtualization Management** – EC2 uses **virtualization** to create multiple virtual machines on a single physical server. This virtualization allows instances to be **provisioned, started, stopped, or resized on demand**, enabling **elasticity**.


## How Virtualization Enables Elasticity
- **Rapid provisioning** – **Virtual instances** can be **launched or terminated in minutes**  
- **Dynamic scaling** – **Resources** can be **scaled up or down** based on demand  
- **Resource flexibility** – Easy to **change instance types, sizes, and configurations**  
- **Automated scaling** – Works with **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** to automatically adjust capacity  

## Key Elasticity Features
- **Launch multiple instances quickly** during demand spikes  
- **Terminate instances** when demand decreases to reduce costs  
- **Change instance types** without physical hardware changes  
- **Use Auto Scaling groups** to automatically maintain **desired capacity**
