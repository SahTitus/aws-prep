This **fully managed service automates the creation, testing, validation, and distribution of custom EC2 AMIs (and container images), ensuring secure, up-to-date, and compliant golden images**.

# VS

**B. Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** – AMI is the **image itself** (a template), not a service for creating or managing images.
