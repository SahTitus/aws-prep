# A **customer-facing application** is any software or service that **end users or customers interact with directly**, such as a website, mobile app, or online service.

* Example: An e-commerce website, a banking app, or a streaming service.
# Because real customers use it, it **must be highly available and reliable--must have consistent uptime.**, unlike internal or batch-processing apps.


# Question

A company is piloting a new **customer-facing application** on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) for one month.  
What pricing model is appropriate?

A. Reserved Instances  
B. Spot Instances  
C. On-Demand Instances  
D. Dedicated Hosts  

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

**Correct answer: C. On-Demand Instances**** ✅  

**Explanation:**  
- **On-Demand Instances** allow you to pay **by the hour or second** with no long-term commitment.  
- Ideal for **short-term workloads**, testing, or pilot projects where usage duration is uncertain.  

**Why the others are wrong:**  
- **A. Reserved Instances** → Require 1- or 3-year commitment; not cost-effective for a one-month pilot.  
- **B. Spot Instances** → Can be interrupted at any time; not ideal for customer-facing applications.  
- **D. Dedicated Hosts** → Provide physical servers for compliance/licensing; unnecessary for a temporary pilot.
