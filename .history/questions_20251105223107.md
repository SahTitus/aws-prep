* # Which Amazon EC2 instance pricing model can provide discounts of up to 90%?

* A. Reserved Instances
* B. On-Demand
* C. Dedicated Hosts
* D. Spot Instances

The correct answer is:

D. Spot Instances ✅

Explanation:

Spot Instances let you use spare EC2 capacity at very steep discounts, sometimes up to 90% off the On-Demand price.

Reserved Instances → Offer discounts (up to ~75%) if you commit to 1–3 years.

On-Demand → Pay full price per hour/second.

Dedicated Hosts → Physical servers for compliance, no huge discount.

Spot Instances are ideal for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads that can handle interruptions.
