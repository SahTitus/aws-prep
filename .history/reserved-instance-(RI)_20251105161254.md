Standard Reserved Instances (RIs)
Best for: Predictable, long-term workloads where you are confident in your instance requirements.
Cost savings: The highest discount rates, up to 60% for a 3-year term, compared to On-Demand prices.
Flexibility: Low. You are locked into a specific instance type, region, and operating system.
Modifications: You can modify certain attributes like Availability Zone, instance size (for Linux OS), and networking type, but not the instance family or OS. 
Convertible Reserved Instances (RIs)
Best for: Workloads with evolving needs, where you want to reserve capacity at a discount but may need to change instance families later.
Cost savings: Lower discounts than Standard RIs, but still substantial savings over On-Demand.
Flexibility: High. You can modify the RI to an instance of a different family, size, or OS.
Modifications: You can exchange them for other instance families, sizes, operating systems, or even regions. 
Scheduled Reserved Instances (RIs)
Best for: Workloads with predictable, recurring schedules that don't need to run 24/7, such as development or testing environments.
Cost savings: Savings of around 5–10% over On-Demand instances used for the same purpose.
Flexibility: Low, as they are designed for a specific, recurring time slot.
Modifications: They are purchased for a one-year term to run on a specific schedule.
