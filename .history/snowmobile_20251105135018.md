### AWS Snow Family (Snowball and Related Devices)

# AWS Snowball*
A data transport and edge computing device offered by Amazon Web Services used to transfer large amounts of data between on-premises environments and AWS without relying on the internet.
It helps migrate terabytes to petabytes of data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.

# Key Insight:
*When internet transfer is too slow or expensive, AWS ships you a physical device — you load your data, return it to AWS, and they upload it to the cloud.*

🧠 Trick: “Snowball = Ship data in a box, not through the net.”

| Device           | Storage | Compute | Main Use              |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------ | :-------------------- |
| Snowcone         | 8 TB    | Yes     | IoT / remote edge     |
| Snowball Storage | 80 TB   | Low     | Bulk transfer         |
| Snowball Compute | 42 TB   | High    | Edge AI / analytics   |
| Snowmobile       | 100 PB  | No      | Data-center migration |

Exam Key Lines
*“Edge processing”* → Compute Opctimized / Snowcone
*“Offline migration”* → Snowball
*“Massive data center”* → Snowmobile
