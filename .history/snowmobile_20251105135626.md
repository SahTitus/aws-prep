### AWS Snow Family (Snowball and Related Devices)

# AWS Snowball*
A data transport and edge computing device offered by Amazon Web Services used to transfer large amounts of data between on-premises environments and AWS without relying on the internet.
It helps migrate terabytes to petabytes of data securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.

# Key Insight:
*When internet transfer is too slow or expensive, AWS ships you a physical device — you load your data, return it to AWS, and they upload it to the cloud.*


# AWS Snowcone
*Description:*
The smallest, most portable device in the Snow Family, ideal for edge computing and smaller data transfers.

*Use Cases:*
 Capturing sensor data in remote or mobile locations (like construction sites or ships), processing data at the edge, and storing data in environments with limited power or space.

Computing: Can run edge computing workloads using services like AWS IoT Greengrass or Amazon EC2 instances. 

# AWS Snowball
*Description:*
 A larger device for more substantial data transfer needs than Snowcone.

*Use Cases:*
 Large-scale data migration, machine learning, and edge computing in disconnected environments.
Variants: Available in storage-optimized and compute-optimized versions.
Status: AWS has discontinued previous generations of Snowball devices as of November 12, 2024. 

# AWS Snowmobile 
*Description:*
 A high-capacity shipping container service designed to move exabytes of data into AWS.

*Use Cases:*
 Very large-scale migrations, such as entire data center moves.
Status: AWS has stopped offering this service, and it has been removed from the company's website, reports say. 

🧠 Trick: “Snowball = Ship data in a box, not through the net.”

| Device           | Storage | Compute | Main Use              |
| :--------------- | :------ | :------ | :-------------------- |
| Snowcone         | 8 TB    | Yes     | IoT / remote edge     |
| Snowball Storage | 80 TB   | Low     | Bulk transfer         |
| Snowball Compute | 42 TB   | High    | Edge AI / analytics   |
| Snowmobile       | 100 PB  | No      | Data-center migration |

Exam Key Lines
*“Edge processing”* → Compute Opctimized / Snowcone
*“Offline migration”* → Snowball
*“Massive data center”* → Snowmobile

🧠 Trick:
*cone → ball → mobile (small → medium → massive).*
