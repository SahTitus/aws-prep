# Seven Migration Strategies

The decision on which strategy depends on factors such as
_the complexity of existing applications_
_business goals_
_time constraints_
_and available resources_

| **Strategy**      | **Description**                                                                                                           | **Trick to Remember**          |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Relocate**   | Changing the hosting location to the cloud, such as moving applications already running as VMs or containers on-premises. | _“Move location, same setup.”_ |
| **2️⃣ Rehost**     | Moving applications without changes (lift-and-shift).                                                                     | _“Host it fast, no change.”_   |
| **3️⃣ Replatform** | Making a few cloud optimizations without changing the core architecture.                                                  | _“Tweak a little.”_            |
| **4️⃣ Refactor**   | Re-architecting applications using cloud-built features to add capability, scale, or performance.                         | _“Rebuild for cloud.”_         |
| **5️⃣ Repurchase** | Moving from a traditional license to a SaaS model (e.g., migrate CRM to Salesforce).                                      | _“Buy new SaaS.”_              |
| **6️⃣ Retain**     | Keeping critical applications in the source environment for now.                                                          | _“Keep for now.”_              |
| **7️⃣ Retire**     | Removing applications that are no longer needed.                                                                          | _“Let it go.”_                 |
