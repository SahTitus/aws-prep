✅ **B. AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)**

### Explanation:

**AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs)** are used in **AWS Organizations** to **centrally control and restrict** what actions and services **member accounts** can use.

They act as **permission boundaries** — even if an IAM user or role has permissions, an SCP can **override** and **deny** specific actions or services.

**Other options:**

* **A. IAM Principals:** Refer to users, roles, or groups — not policies.
* **C. IAM policies:** Manage permissions **within** a single account, not **across multiple accounts**.
* **D. AWS Fargate:** A serverless compute engine for containers — unrelated to access control.
