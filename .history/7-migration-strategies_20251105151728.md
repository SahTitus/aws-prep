| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| **1️⃣ Relocate**   | Changing the hosting location to the cloud, such as moving applications already running as VMs or containers on-premises. | *“Move location, same setup.”* |
| **2️⃣ Rehost**     | Moving applications without changes (lift-and-shift).                                                                     | *“Host it fast, no change.”*   |
| **3️⃣ Replatform** | Making a few cloud optimizations without changing the core architecture.                                                  | *“Tweak a little.”*            |
| **4️⃣ Refactor**   | Re-architecting applications using cloud-built features to add capability, scale, or performance.                         | *“Rebuild for cloud.”*         |
| **5️⃣ Repurchase** | Moving from a traditional license to a SaaS model (e.g., migrate CRM to Salesforce).                                      | *“Buy new SaaS.”*              |
| **6️⃣ Retain**     | Keeping critical applications in the source environment for now.                                                          | *“Keep for now.”*              |
| **7️⃣ Retire**     | Removing applications that are no longer needed.                                                                          | *“Let it go.”*                 |
