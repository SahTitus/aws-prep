# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) Transformation Phases

- **Envision**: Define cloud vision and business value to align stakeholders.  
- **Align**: Identify capability gaps across AWS CAF perspectives and prioritize actions.  
- **Launch**: Execute pilot projects and build foundational cloud environments.  
- **Scale**: Optimize, expand, and standardize cloud operations enterprise-wide.

**B. Align**

In the **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)**, the **Align** phase is where organizations identify capability gaps across the seven perspectives (business, people, governance, platform, security, operations, and data). This involves discovering gaps between current and desired cloud capabilities, prioritizing them, and creating action plans to close them.


- **A. Envision**: Focuses on demonstrating how cloud will help achieve business goals and creating a vision.  
- **C. Scale**: Involves optimizing and expanding successful cloud initiatives across the enterprise.  
- **D. Launch**: Centers on executing pilot projects and preparing foundational cloud environments.

Thus, gap identification using AWS CAF perspectives occurs in the **Align** phase.
