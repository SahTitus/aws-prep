# **Pricing and Support — Highlighted for Easy Learning**

AWS offers customers a **pay-as-you-go** approach for pricing for the vast majority of our cloud services. With AWS, customers pay only for the **individual services** they need, for as long as they use them, and **without long-term contracts** or complex licensing.

---

## **Key concepts of AWS pricing**

### **Pay as you go**

With **pay as you go**, you can adapt to changing business needs and reduce the risk of **overprovisioning** or missing capacity.

### **Save when you commit**

For certain services, such as **Compute services**, **Savings Plans** offer savings over **On-Demand prices** when you commit to a **1-year or 3-year plan**.

### **Pay less by using more**

With AWS, you can realize important savings as your usage increases. For some services, pricing is **tiered**, meaning **the more you use, the less you pay**.

---

## **Driving factors of cost**

The pricing of AWS services varies based on factors such as **service category**, **type**, **configuration**, **AWS Region**, and **pricing model**.
There are **three fundamental drivers of cost** with AWS:

### **Compute**

For **compute** resources, you pay by a span of time (**per hour** or **per second**). Unless using a **reservation**, you pay from the time you **launch** until you **stop** the instance.

### **Storage**

You choose from AWS storage solutions with deep functionality. Pricing largely depends on **how much storage** you have **provisioned** or are **using**.
For services like **Amazon S3**, costs are **tiered**. S3 cost components include:

* **Storage pricing**
* **Request and data retrieval pricing**
* **Data transfer and transfer acceleration pricing**
* **Data management and analytics pricing**
* **Replication pricing**
* **S3 Object Lambda processing price**

### **Data transfer**

There is generally **no charge** for **inbound data transfer** or **in-Region transfers**.
**Outbound data transfer** is aggregated across services and charged at the outbound rate.
The **more you transfer, the less you pay per GB**.
You typically pay **per gigabyte**.

## **AWS pricing scenario**

Using **Amazon EC2**, a compute service:
Costs may be affected by **compute**, **storage**, and **data transfer** depending on configuration and usage.

## **Test your skills — Correct Explanation**

The primary driving factors of cost are **compute**, **storage**, and **data transfer**.
